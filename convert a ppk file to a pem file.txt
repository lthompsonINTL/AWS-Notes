Windows - convert a .ppk file to a .pem file

Start PuTTYgen. For Actions, choose Load, and then navigate to your .ppk file.

Choose the .ppk file, and then choose Open.
    


(Optional) For Key passphrase, enter a passphrase. For Confirm passphrase, re-enter your passphrase.
Note: Although a passphrase isn't required, it's a best practice to specify one. This is a security measure to protect the private key from unauthorized use. A passphrase makes automation difficult, because users must manually log in to an instance or copy files to an instance.
    



From the menu at the top of the PuTTY Key Generator, choose Conversions, Export OpenSSH Key.
    Note: If you didn't enter a passphrase, then you receive a PuTTYgen warning. Choose Yes.
    


Name the file and add the .pem extension.
    


Choose Save.
